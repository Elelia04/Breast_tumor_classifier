#Breast_tumor_classifier

A breast cancer histopathological image classification pipeline using a ResNet-50-based deep learning model, trained across multiple magnification levels. By using transfer learning, data augmentation techniques and patient-wise splitting, both the performance and generalizability were ensured.



Note on .pt model files:

The trained PyTorch model files (.pt) are not included in the repository or in the project zip due to file size restrictions.  
When running the app, the required models are automatically downloaded from Google Drive (see `MODEL_URLS` in the code). No manual action is required.
